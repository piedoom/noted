#WHAT

This is a replacement for the Tumblr web UI utilizing their API

#WHY?

Tumblr's general UX is awful.  The app is unweildy, slow to load anything, offers no accessibility options, and has a limited featureset (e.g. no blocking tags).  Some extensions aimed to fix that problem (like Xkit and MissingE).

#What is the problem with browser extensions?

Browser extensions often broke when tumblr changed something minor.  The aim of this site is to minimize compatibility issues by using features built into the website along with the Tumblr API.  

#What is going to be different?
Function over form.  Pretty things can still be usable - however, I believe tumblr puts unneeded effects that make the webapp feel unusably slow.  This app will keep a nice UI and UX without sacrificing performance.

Usability.  Tumblr lacks basic usability features like text size, high contrast, etc. 

Customization.  Tumblr lacks basic interactivity with tags - for example, blocking a tag.  Don't want to see "#sherlock" anymore?  It's actually not that hard to do. 

Bells and Whistles.  Tumblr lacks quite a few popularly requested features - one of those being an instant messenger.  

Tumblr also has this weird "feature" where script tags added to posts are stripped on the dashboard but completely visible on a user page.  This means anyone can make a post that maliciously replaces all blog contents with a phishing site, or just deface it in general.

tumblr has some great content, but the site needs some work.
